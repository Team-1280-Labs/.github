Hi there 👋
# Team 1280 Labs

### 🏫 About Us
We are the research portion of Team 1280, the FIRST Robotics Team of San Ramon Valley High School (SRVHS). Founded in 2003, our team hails from Danville, San Ramon, and Alamo, California. Initially a class, we've evolved into a dynamic club, participating in the ultimate Sport for the Mind - the FIRST Robotics Competition.

### 🤖 What does Labs do?
Labs is in charge of creating experimental code, or reasearching and testing topics to improve newer robots. After completing research, the projects are archived here to either be used in the future, or saved as a proof of concept.
