Hi there 👋
# Team 1280 Labs

### 🏫 About Us
We are the research portion of Team 1280, the FIRST Robotics Team of San Ramon Valley High School (SRVHS). Created in 2024, our goal is to improve upon old robots and to create newer, advanced features ready for new seasons of FIRST.

### 🤖 What does Labs do?
Labs is in charge of creating experimental code, or reasearching and testing topics to improve newer robots. After completing research, the projects are archived here to either be used in the future, or saved as a proof of concept.
